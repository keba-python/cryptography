This is a simple cryptography ciphers which can be hacked easily using brutefoce attack.
so it help us to understand the besic cryptography concept with a first ciphers.
I did these projects just for practice the very besic cryptography of math and also with a programming language
If you have any question related to the project you can ask me.
